<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an undergraduate student at the School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, specializing in Space Physics. My research focus is on the application of machine learning techniques in the field of space physics. I am fortunate to work under the mentorship of several esteemed researchers, including <a href="https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/yuechao/en/index/3246/list/index.htm">Prof. Chao Yue</a> from Peking University, as well as <a href="https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/jbortnik">Prof. Jacob Bortnik</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jinxingli87/home">Dr. Jinxing Li</a> from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

I am currently engaged in two key research projects. The first, "Modeling the Dynamic Global Distribution of the Ring Current Oxygen Ions Using Artificial Neural Network Technique", has been completed and submitted to the Space Weather journal, where it is under peer review. This project was carried out under the joint supervision of Prof. Chao Yue, Prof. Jacob Bortnik, and Dr. Jinxing Li. My second ongoing project is "Modeling the Local Total Electron Content Using Neural Network Technique," which is conducted under the guidance of Dr. Shan Wang and Prof. Chao Yue from Peking University.

I have collaborated closely with esteemed researchers and am in the process of publishing my findings. As I look forward to furthering my academic career, I am particularly interested in PhD programs that intersect Machine Learning with Geoscience and Space Science.

**Modeling the Dynamic Global Distribution of the Ring Current Oxygen Ions Using Artificial Neural Network Technique**

**Qiushuo Wang**, Chao Yue, Jinxing Li, Jacob Bortnik, Donglai Ma, Chae-Woo Jun

- An artificial neural network model was built to reconstruct ring current oxygen ions using geomagnetic indices as input.
- The model shows high accuracy in out-of-sample tasks and successfully captures the enhancement and decay of oxygen ions.
- The model successfully reproduces the variation of global distribution for oxygen ions of different energies during geomagnetic storm time.

**Modeling Local Total Electron Content Using Artificial Neural Network Technique**

**Qiushuo Wang**, Shan Wang, Chao Yue

- Employing geomagnetic indices as input variables, a neural network model was developed to estimate the Total Electron Content (TEC) in the geographic region of Beijing.
- The constructed model demonstrates superior predictive accuracy in tasks involving unseen data and is capable of accurately capturing the diurnal, seasonal, and annual fluctuations in TEC.
