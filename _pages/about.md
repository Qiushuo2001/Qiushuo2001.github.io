<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), majoring in Space Physics. My research focuses on Earth's magnetosphere dynamics and machine learning's application in space physics. I am fortunate to work in <a href="https://www.space.ucla.edu/jacob-bortnik">Prof. Jacob Bortnik</a>'s research group.

**<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023SW003779">Modeling the Dynamic Global Distribution of the Ring Current Oxygen Ions Using Artificial Neural Network Technique</a>**

**Qiushuo Wang**, Chao Yue, Jinxing Li, Jacob Bortnik, Donglai Ma, Chae-Woo Jun

- An artificial neural network model was built to reconstruct ring current oxygen ions using geomagnetic indices as input.
- The model is highly accurate in predicting non‚Äêtraining set data and successfully captures the enhancement and decay of oxygen ion fluxes.
- The model successfully reproduces the variation of global distribution for oxygen ions of different energies during geomagnetic storms.
